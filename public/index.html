        <h1>Fighting Drought with Mathematical Models</h1>
        <p>During a drought, the reservoirs that provide California's water can reach critically low levels. Caltech researchers have developed a statistical model that might help us better manage our water.</p>
    </div>

<div id="drought-happens" class="panel fader">
    <h1>Drought happens.</h1>
    <p>California has experienced a couple of major droughts recently. When we're in a drought, there are a bunch of negative effects.</p>
</div>
<div id="pdsi" class="panel fader">
    <h1>PDSI measures drought.</h1>
    <p>We measure dryness with the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Positive values indicate wet spells and negative values indicate dry spells. Here are a couple of examples of PDSI values we hit in 2008, 2012, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="reservoirs-matter" class="panel fader">
    <h1>Reservoirs matter.</h1>
    <p>Reservoir levels are affected by drought. Reservoirs are used for drinking water, agriculture, etc. so it's important to not let them run dry.</p>
</div>
<div id="reservoir-management" class="panel fader">
    <h1>People control reservoirs.</h1>
    <p>People make decisions about when to let water out of a reservoir, etc. They do their best to manage the water level so that the reservoir doesn't empty, but sometimes this happens anyway-- and there are consequences for communities when it does.</p>
</div>
<div id="montague" class="panel fader">
    <div class="opacity-screen-3"></div>
    <h1>People managing reservoirs can make mistakes... like in Montague</h1>
    <p>Montague's reservoir ran out and each family had to ration water a LOT.</p>
</div>
<div id="montague-viz" class="panel">
    <div id="slide1-inner" class="relative">
        <div id="slide-1" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;In August 2014, the water level in Lake Shastina, Northern California, dropped critically low. People in the nearby town of Montague were limited to 5.000 gallons of water per home every month, facing fines for overuse.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The average household size in Montague in the 2010 census was 2.5.</p>
        </div>
        <p id="slide-1-2" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">&emsp;&emsp;Showering for 10 minutes per day per person, the average household would use 2,800 gallons of water in a month.</p>
        <p id="slide-1-3" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">&emsp;&emsp;With 5 minutes a day of running water per person, the average household would use another 1,400 gallons in a month.</p>
        <p id="slide-1-4" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">&emsp;&emsp;Flushing the toilet twice per day per person would use 560 gallons.</p>
        <p id="slide-1-5" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">&emsp;&emsp;Finally, one load of laundry and one load of dishes per week, per household, would use another 224 gallons.</p>
        <div id="slide-1-6" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;This example was for the "average" household size of 2.5 without a lawn or garden to water. A real family of three or above would almost surely have faced fines, which begs the question?</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;What can we do to predict critical situations like these?</p>

<div id="seasonality" class="panel">
    <div id="seasonality-inner" class="relative">
        <p class="slide-text">How could Montague not have seen this coming? Well, turns out that the water level in a reservoir varies a lot-- for example, it's highly seasonal. Check out this reservoir. It's pretty hard to predict what will happen to the water level. We need help.</p>
        <div id="seasonality-graphic">

</div>    
<div id="dependencies" class="panel fader">
    <h1>Reservoir levels depend on PDSI.</h1>
    <p>If you're trying to predict how much water you'll have in your reservoir in a couple of months, you might look at rainfall, temperature, snowpack, etc.-- all of these are factored into PDSI. So knowing the current PDSI (are we in a drought? A wet spell?) could help us figure out if our reservoir is in danger.</p>
</div>    
<div id="connectivity" class="panel fader">
    <h1>Reservoirs depend on other reservoirs.</h1>
    <p>It turns out that reservoirs are "connected"-- that is, there's a high correlation between the water levels of some pairs of reservoirs. Sometimes this is for obvious reasons (like they're physically connected), but not always. So it could also help us to look at how other reservoirs are doing, in addition to looking at PDSI.</p>
</div>  
<div id="statistical-model" class="panel fader">
    <h1>Mathematical models can help us predict what will happen to a reservoir.</h1>
    <p>Researchers at Caltech have developed a statistical model that incorporates reservoirs' dependency on PDSI and on each other. This model can help us predict when a reservoir is in trouble.</p>
</div> 
<div id="risk" class="panel fader">
    <h1>What we're measuring is risk.</h1>
    <p>This model measures risk-- in other words, how likely it is that a particular reservoir will drop below x% capacity, given a PDSI of y. If a water manager can tell that a reservoir is at high risk of exhaustion, they can make different decisions and conserve water.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-viz" class="panel fader">
    <h1>The visualization...</h1>
    <p>Try changing the PDSI slider and see how the PDSI affects each reservoir's risk of going below x%.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="panel fader">
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>There's currently no standardized system for how a water manager should respond to a certain PDSI. This model could help water managers identify when a reservoir is at risk and take different actions to avoid situations like Montague's.</p>
