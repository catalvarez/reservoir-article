        <h1>Fighting Drought with Mathematical Models</h1>
        <p>During a drought, the reservoirs that provide California's water can reach critically low levels. Caltech researchers have developed a statistical model that might help us better manage our water.</p>

    <h1 class="title-text">Drought in California</h1>
    <p class="panel-p">In 2015 California experienced one of the worst droughts it has seen in the last 1200 years. Agriculture suffered, snowpack in the Seirra Nevada Mountains shrank significantly, and water use restrictions were put into place across the state.</p>

    <h1 class="title-text">PDSI: Measuring Drought Severity</h1>
    <p class="panel-p">We measure dryness with the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Positive values indicate wet spells and negative values indicate dry spells. In 2015, we were at a PDSI value of {-4}. California's governor declared a state of emergency, {1-2 other big actions that occurred}. Currently in 2018 we are at a PSDI value of {3}.</p>

    <p class="panel-p">{ This needs writing-- we need to explain the fact that PEOPLE (water managers) have some control over reservoir levels (by deciding when to let water out of a reservoir-- is this the only decision people make about reservoirs? When is water usually let out?). They do their best to manage the water level so that the reservoir doesn't empty, but sometimes this happens anyway-- and there are consequences for communities when it does. }</p>

        <h1 class="left">When the Water Runs Out</h1>
        <p>In August 2014, the water level in Northern California's Lake Shastina Reservoir dropped critically low.</p> 
        <p>This resulted in serious water restrictions in the nearby town of Montague, CA.</p>

        <div id="slide-1" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Because of the water shortage, each household in Montague was limited to 5,000 gallons of water a month. Families using more than this amount faced fines.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The average household size in Montague in the 2010 census was 2.5. As it turns out, 5,000 gallons of water doesn't get the average family very far.</p>
        </div>
        <p id="slide-1-2" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">&emsp;&emsp;If each family member takes a 10-minute shower every day, the average household will use 2,800 gallons of water in a month.</p>
        <p id="slide-1-3" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">&emsp;&emsp;If each person uses running water for 5 minutes every day, that's another 1,400 gallons per month.</p>
        <p id="slide-1-4" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">&emsp;&emsp;Flushing the toilet twice per day per person takes another 560 gallons of water.</p>
        <p id="slide-1-5" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">&emsp;&emsp;Just one load of dishes and one load of laundry per week will use 224 gallons of water.</p>
        <div id="slide-1-6" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Even using water conservatively, the average household could easily use 5,000 gallons of water in a month. A family of three or more would almost surely face fines.</p>

        <p>The story of Montague demonstrates that communitites face consequences when a reservoir reaches critically low levels. If we could predict the reservoir's water level a couple of months in advance, we could potentially prevent this. But predicting future water levels is more difficult than it sounds...</p>

            <p class="slide-text">Why can't water managers always tell when a reservoir is at risk? It turns out that reservoir water levels are highly variable, both seasonally and from year to year. Consider the behavior of California's Buchanan Reservoir, shown below.</p>

    <p class="panel-p">If you're trying to predict how much water you'll have in your reservoir in a couple of months, you might look at rainfall, temperature, snowpack, etc.-- all of these are factored into PDSI. So knowing the current PDSI (are we in a drought? A wet spell?) could help us figure out if our reservoir is in danger.</p>

    <h1 class="title-text">Reservoirs depend on other reservoirs.</h1>
    <p class="panel-p">It turns out that reservoirs are "connected"-- that is, there's a high correlation between the water levels of some pairs of reservoirs. Sometimes this is for obvious reasons (like they're physically connected), but not always. So it could also help us to look at how other reservoirs are doing, in addition to looking at PDSI.</p>

    <h1 class="title-text">Conclusion</h1>
    <p class="panel-p">There's currently no standardized system for how a water manager should respond to a certain PDSI. This model could help water managers identify when a reservoir is at risk and take different actions to avoid situations like Montague's.</p>
