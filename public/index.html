        <h1>Mastering Drought using Statistical Models</h1>
        <p>Recents droughts in California have exposed the vulnerability of our water resources, especially the California reservoir system. New research from scientists at Caltech could help us predict water levels and make our water management more resilient to future droughts.

    <h1 class="title-text">Drought in California</h1>
    <p class="panel-p">Drought in California:  From 2012 to 2015, California was in a state of severe drought, on par with the worst 4-year periods in the past 1200 years. The impact of this drought included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sierra Nevada, California’s largest source of water runoff, was 5% of its normal amount.</li>
        <li>9 million fewer acre feet of surface water for irrigation, fallowing a half million acre of land and costing  $1.85 billion for the department of agriculture</li>
        <li>A State of Emergency with over $3 billion dollars allocated to drought relief</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="title-text">PDSI: Measuring Drought Severity</h1>
    <p class="panel-p">Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) is a hydrological measure that uses temperature and precipitation data to estimate relative dryness, without using water level data. The scale of PDSI is from -5 to 5, where positive values indicate wet spells and negative values indicate dry spells. PDSI is used as a tool in water management, aiding the decision-making processes for drought mitigation and response. In 2015, we were at a PDSI value of -4, leading the state to take the following actions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Governor declared state of emergency and created a task force</li>
        <li>Initiated implementation of Initiate of Emergency Action Plan</li>
        <li>Eliminate non-essential water usage, like outdoor water use</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="panel-p" style="margin-top: 10px">Currently, in 2018, we are at a PDSI value of 3.</p>

    <h1 class="title-text">Droughts Drain Reservoirs</h1>
    <p class="panel-p">California’s water comes from two main sources:</p>
    <p>1. Groundwater: water in soil & rocks -- Accounts for 60% of our water</p>
    <p>2. Surface water: water above ground, stored in 1530 reservoirs -- Accounts for 40% of our water</p>
    <p>Reservoirs are man-made water storage that provide for agriculture, industry, power generation, and recreational needs. Reservoirs increase amount of standing available water by 700%. While larger cities have diverse water resources such as multiple rivers and reservoirs, some smaller cities are limited to a single, local reservoir for water.</p>

    <h1 class="title-text">Humans Control Reservoirs 
</h1>
    <p class="panel-p">Unlike most water systems which occur naturally (like lakes), humans play a significant role in the behavior of reservoirs. Every day, water managers decide how much water to release from reservoirs based on today’s demands and future needs. They do their best to manage water levels so that the reservoirs don’t dry out, but sometimes this happens anyway-- and there are consequences for communities when it does.

        <p>In August 2014, the water level in Northern California's Lake Shastina Reservoir dropped critically low. This resulted in serious water restrictions in the nearby town of Montague, CA, affecting their 1300 residents.

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Because of the water shortage, each household in Montague was limited to 5,000 gallons of water a month. Families using more than this amount faced fines.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The average household size in Montague in the 2010 census was 2.5. As it turns out, 5,000 gallons of water doesn't get the average family very far.</p>

        <p>The story of Montague demonstrates that communities face consequences when a reservoir reaches critically low levels. If we could predict the reservoir’s water level a couple months in advance, we could prevent this. But predicting future water levels is more difficult than it sounds.</p>

            <p class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0" id="buchanan-2">In May 2013, the managers of Buchanan Reservoir had a critical decision to make. California was in the middle of a historical drought, the fill season was over, and they had to guess the likelihood of depletion just by looking at the reservoir’s history. Looking at the historical graph, their previous management techniques appeared to be sufficient to keep the reservoir running and satisfy local demands. So the managers chose to conduct “business as usual” and they let the water go.</p>
        <p class="slide-text" id="buchanan-3" style="opacity: 0">Unfortunately, the drought worsened and the reservoir reached critical capacity. The reservoir was practically out of operation between 2014-2015.

            Can we develop better techniques than this naive approach? To develop a good model of the reservoir response to drought conditions, we have to keep a few things in mind...

    <p class="panel-p">It turns out that reservoirs are "connected"-- that is, there's a high correlation between the water levels of some pairs of reservoirs. Sometimes this is for obvious reasons (like they're physically connected), but sometimes there are statistical correlations (for example, from similar geography and water management). Taking into account these connections, as well as PDSI and other external factors, can help us predict how reservoirs will do. </p>

    <p class="panel-p">Researchers at Caltech have developed a statistical model that incorporates reservoir dependency and the influence of external factors. The model is based on thinking of reservoirs as nodes in a graph and edges between nodes representing dependencies between reservoirs. The external factors are characterized as other nodes sitting in this graph impacting each reservoirs. Using historical data, Caltech researchers are able to precisely characterize dependencies of reservoirs and quantify the influence of external factor on reservoirs. One of these external factors is PDSI. Let’s see what this model tells us about the influence of PDSI on the reservoirs … </p>
