        <h1>Fighting Drought with Mathematical Models</h1>
        <p>Recent droughts in California have exposed the vulnerability of our water resources, especially the California reservoir system. Historically, ineffective management of many of the large reservoirs during drought conditions have led to multiple cities running out of water. Could we do better in the future? Caltech researchers have developed a statistical model that may help us manage our water better.</p>

    <h1 class="title-text">Drought in California</h1>
    <p class="panel-p">From 2012 to 2015, California was in a state of severe drought, on par with the worst 4-year periods in the past 1200 years. The catastrophic impact of drought include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Snowpack in the Sierra Nevada, which is the largest sources of runoff water in California was 5% of its normal amount </li>
        <li>Reservoir levels were at an all time low. As an example, Lake Oroville, the second largest reservoir in California, held 66% less water than a normal year</li>
        <li>The drought led to 9 million fewer acre feet of surface water for irrigation, fallowing a half million acre of land. This came at a staggering cost of $1.85 billion for the department of agriculture</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="title-text">PDSI: Measuring Drought Severity</h1>
    <p class="panel-p">Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) is a hydrological measure that uses temperature and precipitation data to estimate relative dryness. The scale of PDSI is from -5 to 5, where positive values indicate wet spells and negative values indicate dry spells. In 2015, we were at a PDSI value of -4, leading the state to take the following actions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Governor declared state of emergency and created a task force</li>
        <li>Initiated implementation of Initiate of Emergency Action Plan</li>
        <li>Eliminate non-essential water usage, like outdoor water use</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="panel-p" style="margin-top: 10px">Currently, in 2018, we are at a PDSI value of 3.</p>

    <h1 class="title-text">Droughts Drain Reservoirs</h1>
    <p class="panel-p">Reservoirs are a key part of the world’s water infrastructure. Their roles include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Intercept water from 53 million km2 = 40% terrestrial environment</li>
        <li>Store 1/6th of total river discharge (7,000–8,300 km3 stored)</li>
        <li>Increase amount of standing available water by 7x</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="panel-p" style="margin-top: 10px;">The state of California has constructed 1,530 reservoirs having a collective storage capacity equivalent to a year of mean run-off from California rivers. The purpose of this system is to create water storage capacity and extend seasonal water availability to meet agricultural, residential, industrial, power generation, and recreational needs.</p>

    <h1 class="title-text">Reservoir Management</h1>
    <p class="panel-p">Unlike most of the components of the hydrological components which occur naturally,  humans play a significant role in the behavior of reservoirs. Specifically, water managers control inflow and outflow of water daily based on complex water demands such as hydropower generation, flood control, irrigation, consumption, and recreation. Water managers do their best to manage the water level so that the reservoirs don’t dry out, but sometimes this happens anyway-- and there are consequences for communities when it does.

        <h1 class="left">When the Water Runs Out</h1>
        <p>In August 2014, the water level in Northern California's Lake Shastina Reservoir dropped critically low.</p> 
        <p>This resulted in serious water restrictions in the nearby town of Montague, CA.</p>

        <div id="slide-1" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Because of the water shortage, each household in Montague was limited to 5,000 gallons of water a month. Families using more than this amount faced fines.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The average household size in Montague in the 2010 census was 2.5. As it turns out, 5,000 gallons of water doesn't get the average family very far.</p>
        </div>
        <p id="slide-1-2" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">&emsp;&emsp;If each family member takes a 10-minute shower every day, the average household will use 2,800 gallons of water in a month.</p>
        <p id="slide-1-3" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">&emsp;&emsp;If each person uses running water for 5 minutes every day, that's another 1,400 gallons per month.</p>
        <p id="slide-1-4" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">&emsp;&emsp;Flushing the toilet twice per day per person takes another 560 gallons of water.</p>
        <p id="slide-1-5" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">&emsp;&emsp;Just one load of dishes and one load of laundry per week will use 224 gallons of water.</p>
        <div id="slide-1-6" class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0;">
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Even using water conservatively, the average household could easily use 5,000 gallons of water in a month. A family of three or more would almost surely face fines.</p>

        <p>The story of Montague demonstrates that communitites face consequences when a reservoir reaches critically low levels. If we could predict the reservoir's water level a couple of months in advance, we could potentially prevent this. But predicting future water levels is more difficult than it sounds...</p>

            <p class="slide-text" id="buchanan-1">Why can't water managers always tell when a reservoir is at risk? It turns out that reservoir water levels are highly variable, both seasonally and from year to year. Consider the behavior of California's Buchanan Reservoir, shown below.</p>
            <p class="slide-text" style="opacity: 0" id="buchanan-2">In May 2013, the Buchanan reservoir managers had a critical decision to make. California was in the middle of a historical drought and the fill season was over. The managers had to make a decision based on the likelihood of water depletion within a given number of years, and has to guess the likelihood of depletion just by looking at his reservoir’s history. Looking at the historical graph, it seems that their previous management techniques have been sufficient to keep the buchanan reservoir running and satisfying the local demands. So the managers chose to act “business as usual” and the let the water go.</p>
        <p class="slide-text" id="buchanan-3" style="opacity: 0">
            Unfortunately, the drought worsened and the reservoir reached critical capacity and became practically out of operation in 2014-2015.
        </p>
        <p class="slide-text" id="buchanan-4" style="opacity: 0">
            Could we develop better techniques than this naive approach? To develop a good model of the reservoir response to drought conditions, we have to keep a few things in mind...

    <h1 class="title-text">Reservoir levels depend on External Factors</h1>
    <p class="panel-p">If you're trying to predict how much water you'll have in your reservoir in a couple of months, factors such as precipitation, snowpack, PDSI, and temperature must be considered. As an example, knowing future PDSI (are we in a drought? A wet spell?) could help us figure out if our reservoir is in danger.</p>

    <h1 class="title-text">Reservoirs depend on other reservoirs.</h1>
    <p class="panel-p">It turns out that reservoirs are "connected"-- that is, there's a high correlation between the water levels of some pairs of reservoirs. Sometimes this is for obvious reasons (like they're physically connected), but not always. So it could also help us to look at how other reservoirs are doing, in addition to looking at PDSI.</p>

    <h1 class="title-text">Mathematical models can help us predict what will happen to a reservoir.</h1>
    <p class="panel-p">Researchers at Caltech have developed a statistical model that incorporates reservoir dependency and the influence of external factors. The model is based on thinking of reservoirs as nodes in a graph and edges between nodes representing dependencies between reservoirs. The external factors are characterized as other nodes sitting in this graph impacting each reservoirs. Using historical data, Caltech researchers are able to precisely characterize dependencies of reservoirs and quantify the influence of external factor on reservoirs.</p>
    <p class="panel-p">One of these external factors is PDSI. Let’s see what this model tells us about the influence of PDSI on the reservoirs...
